A simple password storage and generation app that also securely encrypts said passwords. Everything is also stored locally on your PC, which may or may not be more secure.

Steps for using this app:
1. Create a 32-character password with NO SPACES
   - Make sure to save this password somewhere safe, since it is your encryption key.
2. Click "Generate Password" to create new passwords (or add your own to the Passwords.txt file)
3. Click on "Encrypt File" to encrypt the Passwords.txt file.
   - You can close the app after this.
4. When you re-open the app, enter the SAME encryption key you did before (which is why it is important to write it down).

Liability statement: I am NOT responsible for any issues that occur outside of this program. If your 32-character is stolen (or you give it away unwillingly/unknowingly), or, alternatively, you unknowingly install a trojan virus, I am not liable for the outcomes that arise.

Commercial use statement: If you wish to sell this product, you must consult me first. This is to prevent usage of my work for someone else's financial gain.
